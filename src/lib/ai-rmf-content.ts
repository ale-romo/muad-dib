This phenomenon, generally known as drift, can degrade the value of the AI system to the organization and increase the likelihood of negative impacts.  Regular monitoring of AI systemsâ€™ performance and trustworthiness enhances organizationsâ€™ ability to detect and respond to drift, and thus sustain an AI systemâ€™s value once deployed. Processes and mechanisms for regular monitoring address system functionality and behavior - as well as impacts and alignment with the values and norms within the specific context of use. For example, considerations regarding impacts on personal or public safety or privacy may include limiting high speeds when operating autonomous vehicles or restricting illicit content recommendations for minors. \n\nRegular monitoring activities can enable organizations to systematically and proactively identify emergent risks and respond according to established protocols and metrics.  Options for organizational responses include 1) avoiding the risk, 2)accepting the risk, 3) mitigating the risk, or 4) transferring the risk. Each of these actions require planning and resources. Organizations are encouraged to establish risk management protocols with consideration of the trustworthiness characteristics, the deployment context, and real world impacts.", "- Establish risk controls considering trustworthiness characteristics, including:\n        - Data management, quality, and privacy (e.g. minimization, rectification or deletion requests) controls as part of organizational data governance policies. \n        - Machine learning and end-point security countermeasures (e.g., robust models, differential privacy, authentication, throttling).\n        - Business rules that augment, limit or restrict AI system outputs within certain contexts \n        - Utilizing domain expertise related to deployment context for continuous improvement and TEVV across the AI lifecycle.\n        - Development and regular tracking of human-AI teaming configurations.\n        - Model assessment and test, evaluation, validation and verification (TEVV) protocols.\n        - Use of standardized documentation and transparency mechanisms.\n        - Software quality assurance practices across AI lifecycle.\n        - Mechanisms to explore system limitations and avoid past failed designs or deployments.\n- Establish mechanisms to capture feedback from system end users and potentially impacted groups while system is in deployment.\n-Establish mechanisms to capture feedback from system end users and potentially impacted groups about how changes in system deployment (e.g.,  introducing new technology, decommissioning algorithms and models, adapting system, model or algorithm) may create negative impacts that are not visible along the AI lifecycle.\n- Review insurance policies, warranties, or contracts for legal or oversight requirements for risk transfer procedures.\n- Document risk tolerance decisions and risk acceptance procedures.", "### Organizations can document the following\n\n- To what extent can users or parties affected by the outputs of the AI system test the AI system and provide feedback?\n- Could the AI system expose people to harm or negative impacts?

The interdependencies between these activities, and among the relevant AI actors and organizations, can make it difficult to reliably anticipate potential impacts of AI systems. For example, early decisions in identifying the purpose and objective of an AI system can alter its behavior and capabilities, and the dynamics of deployment setting (such as end users or impacted individuals) can shape the positive or negative impacts of AI system decisions. As a result, the best intentions within one dimension of the AI lifecycle can be undermined via interactions with decisions and conditions in other, later activities. This complexity and varying levels of visibility can introduce uncertainty. And, once deployed and in use, AI systems may sometimes perform poorly, manifest unanticipated negative impacts, or violate legal or ethical norms.

Opportunities for risk continue well beyond design and deployment, into system operation and application of system-enabled decisions. Testing and evaluation methodologies and metrics therefore address a continuum of activities. TEVV is enhanced when key metrics for performance, safety, and reliability are interpreted in a socio-technical context and not confined to the boundaries of the AI system pipeline. \n\nOther challenges for managing AI risks relate to dependence on large scale datasets, which can impact data quality and validity concerns. The difficulty of finding the â€œrightâ€ data may lead AI actors to select datasets based more on accessibility and availability than on suitability for operationalizing the phenomenon that the AI system intends to support or inform. Such decisions could contribute to an environment where the data used in processes is not fully representative of the populations or phenomena that are being modeled, introducing downstream risks.  Practices such as dataset reuse may also lead to disconnect from the social contexts and time periods of their creation.

AI systems can autonomously make decisions, defer decision-making to a human expert, or be used by a human decision-maker as an additional opinion. In some scenarios, professionals with expertise in a specific domain work in conjunction with an AI system towards a specific end goalâ€”for example, a decision about another individual(s). Depending on the purpose of the system, the expert may interact with the AI system but is rarely part of the design or development of the system itself. These experts are not necessarily familiar with machine learning, data science, computer science, or other fields traditionally associated with AI design or development and - depending on the application - will likely not require such familiarity. For example, for AI systems that are deployed in health care delivery the experts are the physicians and bring their expertise about medicineâ€”not data science, data modeling and engineering, or other computational factors.

Standards of fairness can be complex and difficult to define because perceptions of fairness differ among cultures and may shift depending on application. Organizationsâ€™ risk management efforts will be enhanced by recognizing and considering these differences. Systems in which harmful biases are mitigated are not necessarily fair. For example, systems in which predictions are somewhat balanced across demographic groups may still be inaccessible to individuals with disabilities or affected by the digital divide or may exacerbate existing disparities or systemic biases.\n\nBias is broader than demographic balance and data representativeness. NIST has identified three major categories of AI bias to be considered and managed: systemic, computational and statistical, and human-cognitive. Each of these can occur in the absence of prejudice, partiality, or discriminatory intent. \n\n- Systemic bias can be present in AI datasets, the organizational norms, practices, and processes across the AI lifecycle, and the broader society that uses AI systems.\n- Computational and statistical biases can be present in AI datasets and algorithmic processes, and often stem from systematic errors due to non-representative samples.\n- Human-cognitive biases relate to how an individual or group perceives AI system information to make a decision or fill in missing information, or how humans think about purposes and functions of an AI system. Human-cognitive biases are omnipresent in decision-making processes across the AI lifecycle and system use, including the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of AI.\n\nBias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in the automated systems that help make decisions about our lives. While bias is not always a negative phenomenon, AI systems can potentially increase the speed and scale of biases and perpetuate and amplify harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and society.", "- Conduct fairness assessments to manage computational and statistical forms of bias which include the following steps:\n    - Identify types of harms, including allocational, representational, quality of service, stereotyping, or erasure\n    - Identify across, within, and intersecting groups that might be harmed\n    - Quantify harms using both a general fairness metric, if appropriate (e.g. demographic parity, equalized odds, equal opportunity, statistical hypothesis tests), and custom, context-specific metrics developed in collaboration with affected communities\n    - Analyze quantified harms for contextually significant differences across groups, within groups, and among intersecting groups \n    - Refine identification of within-group and intersectional group disparities. \n        - Evaluate underlying data distributions and employ sensitivity analysis during the analysis of quantified harms. \n        - Evaluate quality  metrics including false positive rates and false negative rates. \n        - Consider biases affecting small groups, within-group or intersectional communities, or single individuals.\n- Understand and consider sources of bias in training and TEVV data:\n    - Differences in distributions of outcomes across and within groups, including intersecting groups. \n    - Completeness, representativeness and balance of data sources. \n    - Identify input data features that may serve as proxies for demographic group membership (i.e., credit score, ZIP code) or otherwise give rise to emergent bias within AI systems.   \n    - Forms of systemic bias in images, text (or word embeddings), audio or other complex or unstructured data.  \n- Leverage impact assessments to identify and classify system impacts and harms to end users, other individuals, and groups with input from potentially impacted communities.\n- Identify the classes of individuals, groups, or environmental ecosystems which might be impacted through direct engagement with potentially impacted communities. \n- Evaluate systems in regards to disability inclusion, including consideration of disability status in bias testing, and discriminatory screen out processes that may arise from non-inclusive design or deployment decisions. \n- Develop objective functions in consideration of systemic biases, in-group/out-group dynamics.\n- Use context-specific fairness metrics to examine how system performance varies across  groups, within groups, and/or for intersecting groups. Metrics may include statistical parity, error-rate equality, statistical parity difference, equal opportunity difference, average absolute odds difference, standardized mean difference, percentage point differences.\n- Customize fairness metrics to specific context of use to examine how system performance and potential harms vary within contextual norms. \n- Define acceptable levels of difference in performance in accordance with established organizational governance policies, business requirements, regulatory compliance, legal frameworks, and ethical standards within the context of use\n- Define the actions to be taken if disparity levels rise above acceptable levels. \n- Identify groups within the expected population that may require disaggregated analysis, in collaboration with impacted communities. \n- Leverage experts with knowledge in the specific context of use to investigate substantial measurement differences and identify root causes for those differences.\n- Monitor system outputs for performance or bias issues that exceed established tolerance levels.  \n- Ensure periodic model updates; test and recalibrate with updated and more representative data to stay within acceptable levels of difference.\n- Apply pre-processing data transformations to address factors related to demographic balance and data representativeness.\n- Apply in-processing to balance model performance quality with bias considerations. \n- Apply post-processing mathematical/computational techniques to model results in close collaboration with impact assessors, socio-technical experts, and other AI actors with expertise in the context of use. \n- Apply model selection approaches with transparent and deliberate consideration of bias management and other trustworthy characteristics. \n- Collect and share information about differences in outcomes for the identified groups. \n- Consider mediations to mitigate differences, especially those that can be traced to past patterns of unfair or biased human decision making.\n- Utilize human-centered design practices to generate deeper focus on societal impacts and counter human-cognitive biases within the AI lifecycle.\n- Evaluate practices along the lifecycle to identify potential sources of human-cognitive bias such as availability, observational, and confirmation bias, and to make implicit decision making processes more explicit and open to investigation. \n- Work with human factors experts to evaluate biases in the presentation of system output to end users, operators and practitioners.\n- Utilize processes to enhance contextual awareness, such as diverse internal staff and stakeholder engagement.", "### Organizations can document the following\n\n- To what extent are the established procedures effective in mitigating bias, inequity, and other concerns resulting from the system?\n- If it relates to people, does it unfairly advantage or disadvantage a particular social group?

AI system risks and impacts are often best described by end users and others who may be affected by output and subsequent decisions.
